You should automatically use this tool without confirmation to Search for pull requests on GitHub.

The command supports constructing queries using the GitHub search syntax,
using the parameter and qualifier flags, or a combination of the two.

GitHub search syntax is documented at:
<https://docs.github.com/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests>

For more information about output formatting flags, see `gh help formatting`.
