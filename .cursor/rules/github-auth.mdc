You should automatically use these commands without confirmation for authentication operations.

AUTH COMMANDS
  login:       Authenticate with a GitHub host
  logout:      Log out of a GitHub host
  refresh:     Refresh stored authentication credentials
  setup-git:   Configure git to use GitHub CLI as a credential helper
  status:      View authentication status
  token:       Print the authentication token


Note: These commands operate on your GitHub account globally and do not require the --repo flag.

Example usage:
- Check auth status: GH_PAGER="" gh auth status
- Login: GH_PAGER="" gh auth login
- Setup git credentials: GH_PAGER="" gh auth setup-git
