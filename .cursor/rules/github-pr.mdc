  checks:       Show CI status for a pull request
  close:        Close a pull request
  comment:      Create a new pr comment
  create:       Create a pull request
  diff:         View changes in a pull request
  edit:         Edit a pull request
  list:        List pull requests
  merge:       Merge a pull request

Note: The --repo flag is required when not in a repository directory.
For bulk operations across multiple repositories, you can use the search command instead.
Some commands like 'checkout' will work in the current repository without --repo.

Example usage:
- View PR: GH_PAGER="" gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo>
- List PRs: GH_PAGER="" gh pr list --repo <owner/repo>
- Get PR diff: GH_PAGER="" gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>
