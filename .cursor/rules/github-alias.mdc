You should automatically use these commands without confirmation for alias operations.

ALIAS COMMANDS
  delete:      Delete an alias
  list:        List aliases
  set:         Create a shortcut for a gh command


Note: These commands manage gh CLI aliases globally and do not require the --repo flag.
Aliases can include repository-specific commands when used within a repository.

Example usage:
- List aliases: GH_PAGER="" gh alias list
- Set alias: GH_PAGER="" gh alias set <alias> <expansion>
- Delete alias: GH_PAGER="" gh alias delete <alias>
