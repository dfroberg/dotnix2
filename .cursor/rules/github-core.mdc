Note: Most repository operations require the --repo flag when not in a repository directory.
Some commands like 'browse' and 'clone' always require explicit repository specification.
Organization-level commands may require --org flag instead.

Example usage:
- View PR: GH_PAGER="" gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo>
- List issues: GH_PAGER="" gh issue list --repo <owner/repo>
- View repo: GH_PAGER="" gh repo view <owner/repo>

For detailed help on any command use: GH_PAGER="" gh <command> --help
