COMPLETION COMMANDS
  completion:  Generate shell completion scripts


Note: These commands generate shell completion scripts and do not require the --repo flag.
The generated scripts will handle both global and repository-specific commands.
Scripts should be sourced in your shell's rc file.

Example usage:
- Bash completion: GH_PAGER="" gh completion -s bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gh
- Zsh completion: GH_PAGER="" gh completion -s zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_gh
- Fish completion: GH_PAGER="" gh completion -s fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gh.fish
