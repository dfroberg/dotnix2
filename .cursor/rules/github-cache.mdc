You should automatically use these commands without confirmation for cache operations.

CACHE COMMANDS
  delete:      Delete Github Actions caches
  list:        List Github Actions caches


Note: Cache operations require the --repo flag when not in a repository directory.
These commands manage GitHub Actions caches for specific repositories.

Example usage:
- List caches: GH_PAGER="" gh cache list --repo <owner/repo>
- Delete cache: GH_PAGER="" gh cache delete <id> --repo <owner/repo>
